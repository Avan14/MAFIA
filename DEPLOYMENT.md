# ðŸš€ Mafia Game Deployment Guide

## âœ… Pre-Deployment Checklist

### Server Requirements
- [x] Node.js installed (v14 or higher)
- [x] `ws` package installed
- [x] Port 3001 available
- [x] Firewall configured for external access

### Code Quality
- [x] All critical bugs fixed
- [x] Error handling implemented
- [x] Timeout protection added
- [x] Memory leaks resolved
- [x] Console logs cleaned for production

## ðŸŽ¯ Deployment Steps

### 1. Server Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the server
node server.js
```

### 2. Network Configuration

#### For Local Network (Friends on same WiFi):
1. Find your IP address: `ipconfig` (Windows) or `ifconfig` (Mac/Linux)
2. Share the address: `http://YOUR_IP:3001`
3. Ensure firewall allows port 3001

#### For Internet Access:
1. Configure port forwarding on your router
2. Forward port 3001 to your computer
3. Use your public IP address

### 3. Testing Checklist

#### Basic Functionality:
- [ ] Server starts without errors
- [ ] WebSocket connection established
- [ ] Room creation works
- [ ] Room joining works
- [ ] Player ready system works
- [ ] Game start works
- [ ] Role assignment works

#### Multi-Player Testing:
- [ ] Multiple players can join
- [ ] Host transfer works when host leaves
- [ ] Disconnection handling works
- [ ] Reconnection works

#### Edge Cases:
- [ ] Invalid room codes handled
- [ ] Full rooms rejected
- [ ] Invalid usernames rejected
- [ ] Timeout protection works

## ðŸ”§ Production Optimizations

### Performance
- âœ… Memory cleanup every 30 seconds
- âœ… Efficient WebSocket message handling
- âœ… Timeout protection for operations
- âœ… Connection state monitoring

### Security
- âœ… Input validation on all fields
- âœ… Rate limiting (implicit through WebSocket)
- âœ… Error handling for malformed messages
- âœ… Host-only action protection

### Reliability
- âœ… Automatic reconnection (5 attempts)
- âœ… Graceful disconnection handling
- âœ… State synchronization
- âœ… Error recovery mechanisms

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring

### Server Logs
Monitor these events:
- New client connections
- Room creation/joining
- Game starts
- Disconnections

### Performance Metrics
- Active rooms count
- Connected players count
- Message throughput
- Memory usage

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Port Already in Use**
   ```bash
   # Kill existing process
   taskkill /f /im node.exe
   # Or change port in server.js
   ```

2. **Firewall Blocking**
   - Allow port 3001 in Windows Firewall
   - Configure router port forwarding

3. **WebSocket Connection Failed**
   - Check if server is running
   - Verify port configuration
   - Check network connectivity

4. **Players Can't Join**
   - Verify IP address sharing
   - Check firewall settings
   - Ensure room code is correct
